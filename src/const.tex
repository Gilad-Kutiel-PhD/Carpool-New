In this section we study the carpool problem when the maximum possible capacityis constant.We show that this variant of the problem is APX-hard as well.We also describe and analyze a local search algorithm for the unweightedvariant of the problem, and show that the algorithm achieves a $\frac{C + 1}{2C} - \varepsilon$ approximation ratio for any $\varepsilon > 0$.Throughout this section we consider $C$ to be fixed, and $k$ to be a fixed parameter.
