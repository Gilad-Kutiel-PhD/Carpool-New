In this section we study the \carpool problem when the maximumcapacity is constant, i.e., when $\cmax = O(1)$.  We show that thisvariant of the problem is APX-hard as well.  We also describe andanalyze a local search algorithm for the unweighted variant of theproblem, and show that the algorithm achieves a $\frac{\cmax + 1}{2\cmax} - \varepsilon$ approximation ratio for any$\varepsilon > 0$.
