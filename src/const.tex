In this section we study the \carpool problem when the maximumcapacity is constant, i.e., when $c_{\max} = O(1)$.  We show that thisvariant of the problem is APX-hard as well.  We also describe andanalyze a local search algorithm for the unweighted variant of theproblem, and show that the algorithm achieves a $\frac{C + 1}{2C}- \varepsilon$ approximation ratio for any $\varepsilon > 0$.
