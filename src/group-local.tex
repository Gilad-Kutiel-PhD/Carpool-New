We now argue that a variant of Algorithm~\textbf{EdgeSwap} from
Section~\ref{sec:local} can be used to solve \gcp.
%
The only difference is that when checking feasiblity of a set of arcs
we do not compare the number of passengers to the capacity of a
driver, but rather compare the the total size of the passengers to the
capacity.

\begin{theorem}
There exists a $(\half + \inv{2\cmax} - \eps)$-approximation algorithm
for unweighted \gcp, for every $\eps>0$.
\end{theorem}
