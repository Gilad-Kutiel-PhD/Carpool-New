In this section we present two approximation algorithms for \carpool:
a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that is based on submodular
maximization and a $(\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
which is based on local search.
While the second algorithm presented in this section does not improve upon the
first one, it will be shown that it can be generalized to the \gcp without any
loos in the approximation ratio.
