We present two approximation algorithms for \carpool: a
$\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that is based on unconstrained
submodular maximization and a $(\frac{1}{2}
- \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm which is based on local
search.  While the latter does not improve upon the former, it will be
shown (in Section~\ref{sec:group}) that it can be generalized to
the \gcp without decreasing the approximation ratio.
