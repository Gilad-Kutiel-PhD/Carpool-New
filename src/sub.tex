In this section we show that the problem can be formulated as unconstrainedsubmodular maximization problem, and thus, it has a 2-approximation algorithm.Consider the function $w : 2^V \to \R$ where $w(D)$ is the value of the optimalcarpool matching when the set of drivers is $D$.As we mention in the introduction, $w$ can be computed efficiently.\begin{theorem}$w$ is submodular.
\end{theorem}\begin{proof}Consider two subsets $A,B \subseteq V$, we need to show that $w(A) + w(B) \geq w(A \cup B) + w(A \cap B)$.Let $E_{A \setminus B} = (V \setminus A) \times (A \setminus B)$, $E_{B \setminus A} = (V \setminus A) \times (B \setminus A)$,and $E_{B \cap A} = (V \setminus (A \cap B)) \times (B \cap A)$. Let $M_{A \cup B}$ and $M_{A \cap B}$ be the set of edges in an optimal
matching when the set of drivers are $A \cup B$ and $A \cap B$ respectively.We argue that we can construct two (feasible) matchings $M_A$ and $M_B$ usingthe sets of drivers $A$ and $B$ respectively and $w(M_A) + w(M_B) = w(M_{A \cup B}) + w(M_{A \cap B})$.First, take all the edges from $M_{A \cup B} \cap E_{A \setminus B}$ and add them to $M_A$, add $M_{A \cup B} \cap E_{B \setminus A}$ to $M_B$.Clearly this can be done.Now, split the edges from $M_{A \cap B} \cup (M_{A \cup B} \cap E_{A \cap B})$
between $M_A$ and $M_B$ in a way that does not violate the capacity constraints.One can verify that this can be done.
\end{proof}
