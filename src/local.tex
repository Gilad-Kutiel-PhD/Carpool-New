In this section we consider the unweighted variants of the problem.
We describe and analyze a local search algorithm, 
and show that when the maximum possible capacity, $C$, is fixed, the algorithm achieves 
a $\frac{C + 1}{2C}$ approximation ratio.
Throughout this section we consider $C$ to be fixed, and $k$ to be a fixed parameter.  

The local search algorithm maintains a feasible matching throughout its execution
and operates in 
iterative manner where in each iteration it tries to find a better solution by
replacing a subset of the edges in the current solution with 
another (larger) subset of edges not in the solution.
The local search algorithm halts when no improvement can be done.
The algorithm is described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:local}. 

\begin{algorithm}
\SetKw{True}{true}
\SetKw{False}{false}
\KwIn{$G = (V, E)$, $c : V \rightarrow \N$, $k$}
\KwOut{$M$}
$M \leftarrow \emptyset$								\\
\Repeat{done}{
\label{line:outerloop}
 	$done \leftarrow{}$ \True							\\
 	\For{$M' \in M : |M'| \leq Ck$}{
 		\For{$V' \in V \setminus M : |V'| = |M'| + 1$}{
			\If{$M \setminus M' \cup V'$ is feasible}{
				$M \leftarrow{} M \setminus M' \cup V'$	\\
				$done \leftarrow{}$ \False				\\
			}
		}
 	}
}
\Return{$M$}

We claim that the local search algorithm terminates in polynomial time.
Observed that in every iteration the algorithm either improves the value of the solution
by one or otherwise it stops. 
Thus the algorithm stops after $n$ iterations at most.
Finally, 
in every iteration we examine all the subsets of edges of a fixed size 
and test for feasibility.
Both these operations can be done in polynomial time - $O(n^{Ck + 1})$. 


For two sets of stars $S^*, S$ on a common ground set of vertices $V(G)$,
define the conflict graph $G^{S^*}_{S} = (V, E)$
where $V = \{v_i : s_i \in S^*\}$, 
and $E = \{(v_i, v_j) : 
\exists s \in S : 
\{v_i, v_j\} \subseteq V(s) 
\}$.
Let $w^*(v_i) = 2|E(s_i|$, 
and let $w(v_i)$ be the sum of degrees (in and out) induced by $S$ on vertices in $s_i$. 
That is, the stars in $S^*$ define the vertices in the conflict graph,
and two vertices in the conflict graph are adjacent if there is a star in 
$S$ that intersect the two corresponded stars in $G$.
Figure~\ref{fig:conflict} depicts these concepts.

It is easy to verify the following observation regarding the conflict graph.

\begin{observation}  
The degree of every vertex $v \in V$ is at most $w(v)$.
\end{observation}

For a subset $U \subset V$ let $S^*(U)$ be the set of stars corresponds to 
the vertices in $U$,
$V_U = V(S^*(U))$,
$\overline{V_U} = V(G) \setminus V_U$,
$E^{S^*}_U = E(S^*) \cap V_U \times V_U$,
and 
$E^{S}_U = E(S) \cap V_U \times V_U$.
When $U$ is the set of vertices of a maximal connected component of a conflict graph,
then it is easy to verify that the following observations hold.

\begin{observation}  
$|E^{S}_U| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{u \in U} w(u)$.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}  
$|E^{S^*}_U| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{u \in U} w^*(u) \leq |U| \cdot C$.
\end{observation}

Let $M^*$ be an arbitrary but fixed optimal star family in $G$, 
and let $M$ be the output of the local search algorithm,  
and consider the conflict graph $G^{M^*}_M = (V,E)$,
and let $U$ denote the vertices of a maximal connected component in $G^{M^*}_M$
of size at most $|U| \leq k$ then the following holds:
 
\begin{observation}
$w^*(U) = w(U)$.
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}
Clearly, $E(S) \cap  V_U \times \overline{V_U} = \emptyset$,
or else this is not a maximal connected component in $G^{M^*}_M$.
If $w^*(U) \neq w(U)$ 
the local search algorithm can improve the solution by
replacing the edges $E^{S}_U$ with the edges $E^{S^*}_U$. 
\end{proof}

Let $U$, now, represent the vertices of any connected subgraph of $G^{M^*}_M$
of size $k$, then:

\begin{observation}
$w^*(U) = w(U)$.
\end{observation}




\begin{theorem}
The local search is a $\frac{C + 1}{2C}$-approximation algorithm.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $M^*$ be an arbitrary but fixed optimal matching and let $M$ be the matching from the 
local search algorithm.
Consider the conflict graph.
\end{proof}
