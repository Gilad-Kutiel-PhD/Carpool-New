We now consider a variant of the problem when, in addition to the capacityfunction $c:V \to \N$, and the weight (profit) function $w:A \to \R$, we alsohave a size function $s:A \to \N$, and the constraint $\din[M] \leq c(v)$is replaced with the constraint $\sum_{(u,v)}s(u,v) \leq c(v)$.The motivation for this variant of the problem is when we want to allow a groupof people to travel together in the same car, thus $s$ is the size of the group.We start by showing that this variant of the problem does notfit the submodular maximization formulation anymore.We show, however, that the problem still has a $\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon$-approximation algorithm.Finally, we argue that the local search algorithm can be trivially generalizedto handle the new variant of the problem while keeping the same approximationguarantees.To see why the group carpool problem can not be treated as asubmodular maximization problem considered the instance given inFigure~\ref{fig:not submodular}.\begin{figure}\caption{
\label{fig:not submodular}Consider the following instance where node capacity are written inside nodes, arcs are labeled with their size and all weights are equal to 1.It is easy to see that if $f(S)$ is the optimal solution where $S$ is the set ofdrivers, then $f(A) + f(B) = 2 \leq 3 = f(A \cup B) + f(A \cap B)$,thus, $f$ is not submodular. }\begin{center}\input{fig-not-submodular}\end{center}\end{figure}
