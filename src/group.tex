In this section we introduce the group carpool and show that it does not fit thesubmodular maximization formulation.We show, however, that the problem still has a $\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon$-approximation algorithm.Finally, we argue that the local search algorithm can be trivially generalizedto handle the new variant of the problem while keeping the same approximationguarantees.We start by giving an example why the maximum \textsc{group carpool} problem cannot be formalized as an unconstrained submodular maximization problem asbefore.Considered the instance given in Figure~\ref{fig:not submodular}\begin{figure}\caption{
\label{fig:not submodular}Consider the following instance where node capacity are written inside nodes, arcs are labeled with their size and all weights are equal to 1.It is easy to see that if $f(S)$ is the optimal solution where $S$ is the set ofdrivers, then $f(A) + f(B) = 2 \leq 3 = f(A \cup B) + f(A \cap B)$,thus, $f$ is not submodular. }\begin{center}\input{fig-not-submodular}\end{center}\end{figure}
